1. How map differs from other collection interface? Explain with an example program
Map differs from other Collection interfaces because it stores elements as key-value pairs and does not extend the Collection interface, whereas List and Set store only individual objects.

Example : public class ListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Apple");
        list.add("Banana");
        list.add("Apple");  // Duplicate allowed
        
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

2. Explain the scenario like when to go with manual testing and automation testing
Manual Testing :
Requirement is frequently changing
UI is not stable
Short-term project
Usability testing
Automation Testing :
Regression testing
Repetitive test cases
Large application
Performance testing
Smoke/Sanity testing
Long-term projects
