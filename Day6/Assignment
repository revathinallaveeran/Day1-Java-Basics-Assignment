1. Explain about class and objects
Class : Class is a blueprint to used to create objects.
        A class is a user-defined data type that contains variables and methods.
Object : An object is an instance of a class that contains data (variables) and behavior (methods).

2. Create a program as  follows:

      Parent Class: Person who can walk,run,sit and has attributes height,weight
      Child Class: Student who has own method study and also can inherit the methods and properties from Person
     Print the results

Problem: 
package Java;

class Person{
	double height;
	double weight;
	
	public void walk(){
		System.out.println("Person able to walk");
	}
	
	public void run() {
		System.out.println("Person able to run");
	}
	
	public void sit() {
		System.out.println("Person who can sit");
	}
	
}
public class Inheritance extends Person {
	
	 void study() {
			System.out.println("Student Method");
		}
	 
	 void display() {
	        System.out.println("Height: " + height);
	        System.out.println("Weight: " + weight);
	    }

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Inheritance Student = new Inheritance();
		Student.height = 165.5;
                Student.weight = 60.0;
        
		Student.walk();
		Student.run();
		Student.sit();
		Student.study();
		Student.display();
	}

}
