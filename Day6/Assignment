1. Explain about class and objects
Class : A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It contains variables (data members) and methods (functions).
Object : An object is an instance of a class. It represents real-world entities and contains state (variables) and behavior (methods).


2. Create a program as  follows:
		Parent Class: Person who can walk,run,sit and has attributes height,weight
      	Child Class: Student who has own method study and also can inherit the methods and properties from Person
     	Print the results

Problem: 
package Java;

class Person {
    double height;
    double weight;

    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Person able to walk");
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Person able to run");
    }

    public void sit() {
        System.out.println("Person who can sit");
    }
}

class Student extends Person {

    void study() {
        System.out.println("Student is studying");
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Height: " + height);
        System.out.println("Weight: " + weight);
    }
}

public class Inheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Student student = new Student();

        student.height = 165.5;
        student.weight = 60.0;

        student.walk();
        student.run();
        student.sit();
        student.study();
        student.display();
    }
}
